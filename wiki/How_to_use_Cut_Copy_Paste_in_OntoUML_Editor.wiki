#summary How to use Cut/Copy/Paste in the OntoUML Editor.
#labels Featured,Phase-Support

Avoid using the functions "cut", "copy" or "paste" in OntoUML Editor, because they may corrupt your models. Instead, use the function "duplicate", which is very similar. There are two ways of using "duplicate":

 * Select the classes and relations by pressing Ctrl and when you have selected the last element, keep Ctrl pressed and drag and drop the selection (using left mouse button) in a suitable place for the new elements; or
 * Select the classes and relations by pressing Ctrl -> right click in one of the selected elements -> Edit -> Duplicate -> drag and drop the new elements in a suitable place.
