OntoUML Editor is a model-based graphical editor that supports the creation of conceptual models and domain ontologies in a philosophically and cognitively well-founded modeling language named OntoUML, which is based on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). The editor is designed in a way that, on one hand, it shields the user from the complexity of the ontological principles underlying this language. On the other hand, it reinforces these principles in the produced models by providing a mechanism for automatic formal constraint verification, hence ensuring that the created models will be syntactically correct.

Assessing the quality of conceptual models is key to ensure that conceptual models can be used effectively as a basis for understanding, agreement and construction of information systems. For this reason, the editor is also capable of automatic generation of model instances by transforming these models into specifications in the logic-based language [Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/community). As the generated Alloy specifications include the modal axioms of the foundational ontology underlying OntoUML, named UFO, then the automatically generated instances will present modal behaviour while being dynamically classified, thereby supporting the validation of the modal meta-properties of the OntoUML types.

One can download binaries for the editor at the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/ontouml/downloads/list) tab. See the wiki [How\_to\_install\_and\_run\_OntoUML\_Editor](http://code.google.com/p/ontouml/wiki/How_to_install_and_run_OntoUML_Editor) for further instructions. In order to enable the support for model validation, see the wiki [How\_to\_install\_and\_run\_the\_OntoUML2Alloy\_ATL\_transformation](http://code.google.com/p/ontouml/wiki/How_to_install_and_run_the_OntoUML2Alloy_ATL_transformation).

The UFO and the (later termed) OntoUML language are defined in the Ph.D. thesis of Dr. Giancarlo Guizzardi, named "[Ontological Foundations for Structural Conceptual Models](http://www.utwente.nl/ewi/asna/research/Ph.D.%20Theses/guizzardi-thesis.pdf)".

The creation of this tool is documented in the M.Sc. thesis of Alessander Botti Benevides, named "[A Model-based Graphical Editor for Supporting the Creation, Verification and Validation of OntoUML Conceptual Models](http://code.google.com/p/ontouml/downloads/list)".

This research is also reported in a number of papers. The model building and verification capabilities of the OntoUML Editor, as well as its architecture, are reported in `[Benevides and Guizzardi 2009`].

Moreover, the tool for assisting model validation, its architecture and transformation patterns
are reported in `[Benevides et al. 2009, Braga et al. 2009, Benevides et al. 2010, Braga et al. 2010`].
